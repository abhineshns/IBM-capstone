# Introduction
## Each day thousands of road accidents are happening in todayâ€™s world, . Road accidents will consist a good percentage among all accidents in a given country. Many loses lives and so many getting injured everyday in road accidents. The road accident can happen because of many reasons. Many factors can influence the cause of road accidents like the condition of the road, condition of light and so on. Similarly depending on various factors severity of the road accidents can vary. With proper data of the past accidents we can model a good performing machine learning model that predict the severity of the accidents. Identifying the various factors that influence the severity of the road accidents and making this as our independent attributes of our model and the corresponding severity score will become the target variable.
## This model can be used to calculate the severity of future accidents and we can modify several factors in the road to reduce the severity of future possible accidents. So the effective use of the model eventually can save lives of several persons.
